    Use alias command to make other name for command in terminal(or shell)
    Ex: alias <name>='command' (alias ls='ls -a')

    To check if a command is alias or not use type command
    Ex: type <command name> (type cp)
    real command -> path is returned
     alias -> alias or somthing like that

     To remove alias use unalias command
     Ex: unalias <command name> (unalias cp)

     
     Some time you just want to disable alias one time to use other options and 
     then use alias again. There are a couple ways to do it
     
     1: use the whole path of the command
     Ex: /bin/ls (ls's path)

     2: use command
     Ex: command <alias>

     3: use escape backslash '\'
     Ex: \<alias>
