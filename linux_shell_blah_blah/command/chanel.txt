 When user use cat command a standard input chanel called stdin is opened - a chanel is the way 
 that data flows - so when we used command a chanel is opened and the data start exchanging. 

Here we have three standard I/O chanel:
    stdin: the standard input of program, usually keyboard is used
    stdout: the stadard output of program, usually the terminal's display is used
    stderr: the standard error message's output of program, like stdout usually terminal's terminal
    is used

In every command we hav these 3 to I/O.

When user used the cat command without any argument the stdin will be opened and everything you input
will be the stdout

Standard Input リディレクトリ:
    There is a thing called リディレクトリwhich mean changing the std I/O destination use < to 
    activate it with cat and it will just output what is inputed (content of file). Maybe it is 
    hard to understand now but afterward it will be very useful to create your own command
    Ex:
        "cat < /etc/crontab" != "cat /etc/crontab"

Standard Output リディレクトリ:
