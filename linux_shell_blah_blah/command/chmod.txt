    Use to change the file mode. In chmod you can change mode with symbol or 
with number.
    
    Caution: only the owner of the file or super user can change the mode of file

Symbol mode:
    chmod [ugoa][+-=][rwx] <file name>
    
    mean: change mode [u...]who [+...]can [r...]do something file name
u: owner
g: group
o: other user
a: all of the above

+: add permission
-: ban permission
=: set permision exactly like this

Ex: chmod go-wx file.txt


    A little bit different from symbol mode numberlic mode is absolute(which I 
    don't understand the different either)
Numberlic mode:
    chmod <octal number> <file name>

4: stand for r
2: stand for w
1: stand for x

the sum of the permission you allow will be the octal number
Ex: rw is 6, wx is 3, rwx is 7

and will be place to follow the order of owner - group - others
Ex: owner(rwx 7) group(r-x 5) others(r-- 4) -> chmod 755 file.txt
