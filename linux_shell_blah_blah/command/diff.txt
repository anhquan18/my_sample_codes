     First there will be a line with number show where is the place has been 
     edited it will be shown like this:

        with 3 type: a, c, d stand for Add Change Delete
        
        <1>a<2>: the content after range1 of file number 1 is added from range2 
                    in file number 2
        <1>c<2>: the content in range 1 file 1 has been changed by range2 file2
        <1>d<2>: the content in range 1 has been deleted

    This one is very useful try it with the x_o_game you created

    Next:

    Unified(become united, one) is an option -u of diff it will show you the two files being unified
    in one and: 
        @@@ : symbol stand at the head of each hunk (place changed) and there will be number 
        like this @@ -21,8 +21,5 @@ stand for started place, number of lines have been changed
        -   : stand for the deleted codes
        +   : stand for the appeded codes
     for short it show you something close to the one on github (git using the unified format)

     The output(difference) that turn into a file called patch (I don't understand this part well).
     But just remember that the diff and relate quite a lot to the version management and unified are
     being used quite a lot (Ex: git)
