 Normally outside command can't read shell's vari so to let the outside command
 read the vari we have environment variable (shell can read this as well)

 Environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running 
 processes will behave on a computer, because of the environment variable that 
 LANG take, the output of other command will also change
 Ex: LANG=<different language>
     cat --help -> different language come out 
     This is not because of bash, cat read the environment variable and then 
     change the output base on it

 To see all the enviroment variable's configuration use
 printenv

You can configure the environment variable with export 
    export <shell variable's name>
    (We use shell variable like environment variable, doing this you add 
    some automatical things to command or something like that)
    
    Ex:  LESS='--no-init'
           export LESS

     Or: export LESS='--no-init'
