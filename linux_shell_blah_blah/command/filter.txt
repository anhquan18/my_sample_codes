    NOTE: when you not put anything into the input of a command than it will take anything from the stdin and use it for the input

    In Linux we have commands that receive something as input and will output 
    the same thing. In here, we have head command this command work like cat will 
    output the content of the file that you input but you can limit the number of 
    line outputed (use man), the default of line will be 10.
     
     You can use this with history as well
        Ex: history |head

     Common filter used in Linux: any input for these command can be a file or 
     output of other files
        cat
        head
        tail
        grep
        sort: sort line of text file Ex: sort abc.txt (by default it will sort by dictionary order), can be used to sort ps as well as any output
        uniq: 
        tac:  concatenate and print files in reverse
        wc:   print the count of byte, newline, word in the file/ output (print line word bytes file_name by default) Ex: ls / | wc -l

     Use man to find out about them

     With this filter (using pipeline) the output will be much easier to read
