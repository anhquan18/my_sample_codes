history file for bash/terminal command is ~/.bash_history

Do not put space between = and your vari or shell will think it is a parameter for
command
when call out the var of shell remember $  

To change the output of prompt, input the things you want to output into the 
PS1 

Ex: PS1='\[\033[01;35m\] \d-\t \[\033[01;32m\] \h\u:\n \[\033[01;34m\] \w\n \[\033[0m\] \$'

\d: day, month
\h: host name
\u: user name
\w: current dir (like pwd)
\W: current dir's name only
\n: new line
\t: time (hour minute second)
\$: root user #, others $
\\: \

Search for colors on the bookamrk's list of google

add color to prompt:
bold white  : \[\033[01;37m\]
bold red    : \[\033[01;31m\]
gray        : \[\033[01;30m\]
bold yellow : \[\033[01;33m\]
bold blue   : \[\033[01;34m\]
bold green  : \[\033[01;32m\]
bold orange : \[\033[01;35m\]
bold cyan   : \[\033[01;36m\]
reset       : \[\033[0m\]

Change the 01 to 0 or 1 to try different colors


You can create your command and then after that you can use it without type the 
ful pass, all you have to do is input the value into the searching path

Builtin command: command that shell created inside it (Ex: set)
Outside command: command that having a file to tell the content of it (Ex: cp)
to know which is outside which is builtin use type

Normally outside command can't read shell's vari so to let the outside command
read the vari we have environment variable (shell can read this as well)

Environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running 
processes will behave on a computer, because of the environment variable that 
LANG take, the output of other command will also change
Ex: LANG=<different language>
      cat --help -> different language come out
 This is not because of bash, cat read the environment variable and then change
 the output base on it
