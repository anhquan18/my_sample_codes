    There is a function called pipe_line in linux that help connect the output of a command to the 
    input of another command (the thing that send the output of a command directly to other 
    command). We use | symbol (pipe) to work with pipe line:
        <command_1> | <command_2> [| <command_3...]
     
     And the stdout of c1 will be stdin of c2(which is parameter of c2) and if 
     we have 3 same thing happen
        Ex: ls -a |grep python
    When you need to see the output of something but it is too long and not fit in
    one window we use pipe_line with less to make it easier to read
        Ex: history |less
              ls -l| cat -n| less
     With this you can fit everything into a page

     Normaly (spell missed?) you can't put stderr into pipe line (try) but by 
     using 2>&1 you can put the stderr into the pipe.
