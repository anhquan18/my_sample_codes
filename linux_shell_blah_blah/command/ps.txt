    ######
    NOTE: This command has two different type of option:
    UNIX option: need - when use option
    BSD option: don't need -
    the same character for each option have different meaning that is why you need
    to remember it different (read man to learn more)
    NOTE_2:
     All of this proccess are how you look from the kernel not the shell
    ######

    Those executed program running in memory are called proccess. Every proccess 
 have different id in linux use ps to find it out. There are something called 
 parent proccess and child proccess (Ex: excute ls command in shell will make 
 shell be the parent proccess and ls be the child)

    ps will show you the running proccess. There will be some collums(field) be outputed
which are:
PID: proccess ID
TTY: teletype terminals (you don't need to understand now but it is ready saved
in bookmarks), the pts0 or pts1,.. mean the name of the terminal you are working
(I think), if it show ? then it mean daemon(the proccess are not connect to terminal)
TIME
CMD: command being excuted

    There are many system ps manage the user ps running by user as well, these ps
 were runned by super user (use ps ax to find out), these are the multitasking,
 run at the same time by Linux, when you login.

xf: To show the parent child relation (the \_)
x: show all the proccess of the user that runned the ps command
ux: show all the detail about proccess of the user that runned the ps command
ax: show all the proccess of all user
