    Use set or shopt to set option for bash (the simple way, you'll use shell
    script to set option for bash later)

    Use -o and +o to set (-)on (+)off
        
        set -o/+o <option name> 
        (close to vim script, I still knowing nothing about vim script)
        
        Ex: set -o ignoreeof (ignore ctrl+d use to avoid typing the wrong key and
        make the shell stop)
     
    ##########
     Use man bash to search for more option to set(it's very very long so make 
     sure to use the / to find the word you need)
    
    ########
     REMEMBER THAT THE OPTION THAT SET CAN SET IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT SHOPT CAN
    ########

     Use shopt to set on off for option (like set but have many more option than
     set)
        
        shopt -s/-u <option name>
        (-s to on, -u to off)
        
        Ex: shopt -s autocd 
        (you just have to type the name of the dir and it will move automatically)

        There are lots of option for shopt that's why if you can master this 
        it'll be very helpful again you can find the option for shopt by using man
