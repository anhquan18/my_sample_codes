    source command will run the content inside the any file that is given to the command
    Ex: source ./file_name.sh
    And it will run one line by one code to the terminal, the shell run it will be the shell in 
    current dir so you don't need to add shebang to the file
    And this command don't execute the file directily so you don't need to give it the mode
    Seem like we have the dot command for the old sh as well
    Ex: . ./file_name.sh

    Normally you have to give source the file name in current dir or give it
    the path of the file but once you add the path of the file to $PATH
    you can run source with file any where you want and won't even need to
    give it the path anymore 
    source file_name
    
    You can prevent source command use $PATH by using 'shopt -u sourcepath'
