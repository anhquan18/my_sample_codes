    same file or in the output and return the new output. By default it only 
    matching those repeated line that following each other

    So if these line are repeated it will matching them in once, those line that
    are seperated by others lines will not be count as repeated: try to sort these

    Me

    If you want to eliminate all of those same word you can use with sort and then
    uniq the output, or you can just the option u of sort and sort will eliminate
    those overlap things for you
    If you to count or do other things to those duplication read the man to use
