    case is kind of like the switch function and we have pattern, if pattern match
    it execute the code inside ) and ;; it start with case and end with 
    esac (inverted version of case)
    Ex:
        case <string> in
            <pattern1>)
                proccess1
                ;;
             <pattern2>)
                proccess2
                ;;
             ...
        esac

    Try esac file
    And you can use | to have multiple pattern in one line as well and if pattern
    match one or another the proccess will be executed
