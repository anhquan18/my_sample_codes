    ##### For
    for loop use loop proccess kind of like python 
        for var in list
         do
             proccess
         done
     
     Ex:
        for name in aaa bbb ccc
         do
              echo $name
        done

    When you want to use all the .txt file in current dir you can put all of them
    into the list like what we do s_status file

    And you can also place command instead of a list as well. In here, we have a 
    command called "seq" which print out a sequence of numbers we can use it to
    create a list
    try try_for file

    You can output all of the pos parameter of the file by using the $@ 
    Ex:
     for parameter in $@
    do 
        echo $parameter
    done

    You can remove the in list of for loop and the $@ will be the default of for
    Ex:
        for para in $@
         for para 
         Is two same thing
         

    ##### While
    while loop just like while loop like other programming language
     Ex:
        while <command>
         do
             loop proccess
        done

    ##### Calculation operator
    You can use $(()) or let "" to do the calculation you need search more about
    it 
    Ex: 
        i=0
        i=$((i + 10 * 10 - 10 / 2))
        echo $i

        let "i * 2 + 10 / 2 - 15"
        echo $i
