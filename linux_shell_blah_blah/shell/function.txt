    ##### Function
    Like other programming language we have function to do the stuff we need, in
    shell script it is little bit like alias
    Ex:
        function <function_name> ()
        {
            proccess
         }
     You can remove the () part as well or even the function statement
        function <function_name>
        {
            proccess
        }

        <function_name> ()
        {
            proccess
         }

         Try testunc file

     Note: You have to define the function in the line before the line you execute
     the function
