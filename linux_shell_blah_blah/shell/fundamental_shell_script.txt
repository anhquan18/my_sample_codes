    Use and Explanation
    ########
    

    ##### New line 
    You can use ; to execute many command in one line
                    \ to keep writing the code in a new line
     
     When you execute 'echo \' the prompt will change from $ to > it mean the command line still 
     haven't finished, input something. This is the secondary prompt, you can customize it with PS2 
     var, input \ then another line will come out, enter to finish this
     Ex: echo \ 
          "hello \
          world"

     You can do the same thing with | pipe line
     Ex: ls |
          sort


     ##### Variable
     Shell have var to storage value like other programming language as well, it's called shell var.
     To reference the value of var we add $ to the head of the var
     Ex: var='Hello Me'
          echo $var

     Remember that the do not add $ to the head var when subtitute the value to var, and do not add 
     space before or after the = symbol, you can use both upper case and lower case letter for var, 
     but normally Upper stand for enviroment var and lower case stand for normal var
     
     This is an example of a fault case:
     filename=J.Johnson
     echo $filename_backup  #If we do this then nothing will be output because you are calling an 
     unexist var. To fix this you add {} to the var and shell will understand that you are calling 
     out the var
     echo ${filename}_backup


     ##### Quotes
     With quotes you can tell to shell that any thing inside it is a word like this:
     ' or " can be fine, vi 'This whole thing is a word'.txt
     And meta character is meaningless inside quotes. But  there is an exception with ' and "
     Ex: country=Japan
          echo 'We are in $country' $ is meaningless inside single quote
          echo "We are in $country" but in double quotes it mean calling out the var
     You can use \ to disable the meaning of $ inside "

    
    ##### Command substitution
    It is a little bit like stdout, thanks to this we can get the result of a command as a string 
    All you have to do is put the command whose result you want to get inside $( ) and the whole
    $(command_name) will be replace as the stdout of the command
    Ex: echo $list

          Now we will try an example with date command. Specify the date command's argument like 
          this (don't even understand) +%Y-%m-%d then the output can be YYY-MMM-DDD. With this you
          can create dir with today date as the dir's name like this:
            d_name=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")
            mkdir "$d_name"
     You can also use `` as the same meaning as $()
     Ex: echo "we have $(ls)" is echo "we have `ls`"


    ##### Position argument
    Till now we have used many kind of argument for the command line in shell like file, output,dir.
    Shell treats all of them as the position argument, shell's var. All of them stand in order like
    this : ./argument.sh aaa bbb ccc
                    $0         $1  $2  $3
     The $0 is one of the special argument, try the file outside(you can also try the * to see it)
     And you can know the number of position you have been inputed in shell script by echo the 
     special var '$#' in the last line of shell script

    Normally the position argument will be splited out automatically. But with '$@' or '$*' you can
    summarize all of the argument into one try the argument file. It seem that @ and * do the same
    thing but when surrounded by " they are not at all. If we have the total number of pos argument
    then they will expand the pos arg like this:
    "$@": "$1" "$2" ... "$N"
    "$*": "$1 $2 $3 ... $N"
    
    $@ are mostly used
