    ls -l / | cat -n | less -> this will be one line that have three ps)

    From shell if it is one line it will be counted as one job
    In shell for each job we have job ID (1,2,3,... ), if you open two shell at 
    the same time the job ID will be the same (like shell0 job0, shell1 job0)

    You can do the same thing with job just like what you can do with ps, if
    you can master it things will be lots easier(like ctrl z something 
    do something else then come back keep doing what you stopped)

    Use jobs to show all the job in the shell that you runned:
                    jobs
    option:
    -l: who the job's ps ID

    To make the job running again after stopped by ctrl z use:
     fg command (foreground):
        fg %job's ID

     When there is a long ps that you want to make it run in the background so you
     can use the command line (don't have to waste time), you use bg command
     first stop the job and then use:
        bg %job's ID
     with this you can work more conveniently (use jobs to check if it was running
     or not - if it is running in the background then it will have the & mark 
     at the end) and of course you can make it foreground from here as well

     If you want to run a ps in bg at first just add & to the end of the command
     then done

     NOTE: all of these 3 are shell builtin command

    You can kill job like ps as well use:
    kill %job's ID (kill %1)
