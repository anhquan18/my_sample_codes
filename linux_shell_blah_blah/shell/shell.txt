    There is a thing called login shell which is a thing that activated when linux
 is booted. To find where is login shell: use echo $SHELL
    
    There are many type of shell: sh, csh, bash, tcsh, zsh
 
    sh: 
        Called Bshell, have long history, generaly used, commonly used shel.
        Old and has few 
         functions that why it's not used as the login shell today
    
    csh: 
        have long history like sh but have more functions, and are more 
        convenience than sh. Cshell have many diff in grammar from Bshell. 
        Having many defect make it unsuitable. Because of successor tcsh it 
        mostly doesn't  used nowaday

backward compatibility: compatible with something but it is a newer veresion of it.
    
    bash: 
        expansion version of the Bshell, have many more functinon, having 
        backward compability with Bshell so you can just relace sh with 
        bash. Having many functinons, setted as default login shell in
        many linux enviroments, very suitable for shell scripts.

    tcsh: 
        designed to be the successor of the csh, it has lots of convenient 
        functinos. Like csh, it is not suitable for shellscript for some 
        reason. The prompt of tcsh is % not $. Being the login shell
        of FreeBSD but its user is getting fewer and fewer every years. 

    zsh: 
        the new shell, having a lot of function. Based on sh and bash but 
        actively capturing other fetures from other shells. Famous 
        because of its convenience (should learn in the future). It is 
        advanced so it is not suitable for beginner
