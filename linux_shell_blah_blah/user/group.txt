    In linux many user can access one machine in the same time that is why there
are permission for each file(which you are already know)
    
    There are many groups (which have many users) and each group can let its users
have the same permission. Each user have to belong to one group (at least I think)

    If you don't specify the name of the group at first it will be the same as
your user's name
    
    Use groups command to check the groups
