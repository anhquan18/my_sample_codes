    Use ls -l to find out the file's permission
    The output will have 10 chars at the head of the line, first char will be
 file's type, next 9 will be the file mode split to 3 groups by each 3 char
 and will stand for the permission of owner, group, other users.
    
    There are three symbols(permission):
r: read
w: write (file can still be delete from outside)
x: execute
-: don't have permission


    Like file, dir also have the permission as well, and also have the rwx but 
in a different meaning
r: can read (using ls to see the content inside dir)
w: can create and remove file from dir (not relate to file permission)
x: cd into the dir

    Some time all of those symbols can be number

    You can use chmod command to change the file mode
