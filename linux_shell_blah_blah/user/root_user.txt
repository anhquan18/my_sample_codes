    There is a special user called super user or roots user or you can call root
that has many strong authority to your system (change configuration of file, 
install new package, application, update, upgrade system) which normal user are
not allow to do it. Super user are not effect by any permission(in my knowledge
for now). In order to do all of these things we need the authority of super user.

    Because super user have so many authority, it can destroy all of the linux 
system by some wrong action that is why normally we login as normal user and
only use super user when needed by using su or sudo command

    In linux super user can login from this user to other without logout (login to
 super user)
    Use sudo + command and somthing to execute the command as a different user. 
    When not specified the user will be root user
    To use super user's authority just once: sudo <command name> 
    To use it continuously: sudo su (and then the prompt will turn into #)
    
    You can initialize the environment of super user with sudo su -

    The big different between sudo and su is sudo need the password of your user,
    su need the default password of root user(which I don't know)

    CAUTION
    #########

    In different linux distrubution you'll be allowed to use sudo or not. To check
if you are allowed to use sudo whether or not, see the /etc/sudoers file.

    sudoers file's structure is written like this 
    '<user><machine_name>=(<authority>)<command>', in the user you can write 
directly the user name or %<group_name> to change it. If you have the 
authority of super user it will be like this:
    nguyen ALL=(ALL) ALL     note: It is different now so you should search by 
yourself to have more information.
    It mean the nguyen user in all of the machines can be as all of the users can 
    execute all of the commands with sudo. And group has the same meaning
    %group_name ALL=(ALL) ALL

    sudoers file is very important so user should becareful when configuring this
 file, if you make a few misses there will be a big problem with the security
 that is why you have to be very carefully configure it

    Use visudo to configure the file
