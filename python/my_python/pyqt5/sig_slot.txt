    When an event takes place a signal will be emitted by widget and a slot_method(action) or a function connected 
    to that widget will be called.

    The principle of connecting signal to slot or function is applied by all widget:
    widget.signal.connect(slot_method)

    You can define a signal as well:
    QtCore.QObject.connect(widget, QtCore.SIGNAL('signalname'), slot_function)

    Pyqt support many signal not just click
