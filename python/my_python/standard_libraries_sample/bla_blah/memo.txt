local() -> return the dictionary of current local variable
globals -> return the dictionary of current global variable
you can access the global var with global var_name

those var have __ in the start and end of their name are special var used within
python so you should not use it for your var

underscore use:
1. Used in the interpreter to call out the last val
2. ignore val (Ex: x,_,y = 1,2,3 # x = 1, y = 3)
3. give special meaning to name of var and func
    (any var was written like this _varname will be private and can't be seen from
    outside in from module import *)
    (like var func and class can also be private as well like this _funcname 
    private func. _class private class)
