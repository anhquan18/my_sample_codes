    Those classes created inside class in robocup source code usually be called in
    __init__ and be saved as the secret vari of class which can only be callout
     Ex: self.__brain = self.Brain()
          def brain(self):
            return self.__brain

     Doing this will make it more security and you cannot find it from the outside
     and only know it exist if you read the source code
